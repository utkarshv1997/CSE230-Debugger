The Delta Debugger has three "views", namely :
1. The Code View        : Where your code gets displayed
2. The Stack View       : Where the contents of the programs stack get displayed
3. The Variables View   : Where the currently defined variables in the program is being executed
                          are displyed.
4. The Help View        : The "How to" guide.

Navigating through the Delta Debugger :
- Use the Up, Down, Left and Right Arrow Keys to navigate in a View. You could also use the mouse for navigating Up and Down.
- Use `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` to toggle and toggle-backwards between Views.
- The currently "focussed" View will be evidently visible, scrolling obviously takes effect only on that particular view.
- Use the `Esc` key to stop the debugger program and exit the debugger terminal.

Using the Delta Debugger :
- Use the `b` key to place a breakpoint on the currently selected line.
- Use the `b` key to delete the breakpoint on the currently selected line, if one is already present.
- Use the `r` key to run your program.
- Use the `n` key to continue to the next breakpoint in your program.
